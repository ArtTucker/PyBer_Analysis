# PyBer Analysis
Data Analysis with Matplotlib

## Overview
The overall purpose of this project was to provide visual analysis of the performance of a rideshare company, and it's drivers, across three different city types - urban, suburban, and rural. The starting data consisted of two separate CSVs. One was of anonymized ride data from the early months of 2019, containing:
- the name of the city in which the ride took place,
- date & time of the ride,
- the ride fare,
- a unique ride ID number.
The other CSV consisted of regional market data, containing:
- city names,
- the number of drivers in each city,
- how that city was classified (urban, suburban, or rural).
